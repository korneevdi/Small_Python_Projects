This repository contains a collection of various Python utility functions that I have developed over time to help simplify my workflow and improve my productivity. One of the primary goals of nppy is to provide an intuitive and easy-to-use interface for common tasks in Python programming. I have designed each function to be as concise and efficient as possible while still maintaining readability and flexibility. All programs are publicly available and anyone can use them.

To use one of these programs, you can clone the repository using the command

"git clone https://github.com/korneevdi/Small_Python_Projects.git"

After that, open the file you need in the development environment you are working in and run it.
