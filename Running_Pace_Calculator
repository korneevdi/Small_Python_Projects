"""
I am a sportsman :)
I am a mid- and long-distance runner, and before races I often calculate the desired pace to get an idea of how fast I need to run to achieve my goal.
For this I use this program. With its help, you can calculate your running pace if you know the distance and desired finish time.
In addition, you can calculate the finishing time if you know the distance and pace of the run.
